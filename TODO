- Syntax:
  * for ... in ... do ... end
  * restargs
  * raw strings
  * labels, goto
  * one argument calls
  * don't parse -x"a" as (-x)"a"
- Interpreter:
  * IMPORTANT - does a,b = 1 set b to nil, or leave it unset?
  * IMPORTANT - test the behavior of (x()) vs x()
  * threads
  * labels, goto
  * multiple local assignment
  * metatables
  * error propagation
  * Multiple value collapse is still glitched to hell (see smth like #..., which btw shouldn't even parse at all)
  * Fix the unstable ass next(...) function
  * not, or, and
- Standard library:
  * implement base [2/?]
  * implement table [5/7]
  * implement string [0/?]
  * implement coroutine [0/?]
- Scratch compatibility (for later):
  * Convert lexer & parser into Lua
  * Make the code procedural
  * Drop all dict usage, use single table registry
  * Implement own GC for said table registry
